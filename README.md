This is a Minecraft resource pack that adds outlines to ores in mods, making them more visible.
It is trying to be compatible with all mods that add ores.
It will probably be compatible with OptiFine's connected textures.

# Compatible mods :
## Supported :
- [Universal Ores](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal_ores)
## Work in progress :
- [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) and [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric)
## More to come !
